# Welcome to HomeFleet üöÄ 

This is my main stack that I run at home everyday. You'll see a wide range of container configurations.

My thought process behind creating these is for education, automation, efficiency, and conveniency. The best way to learn for me is by doing.

I have the containers grouped by category (core, media, monitoring).

```
services/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frigate
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ homeassistant
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ portainer
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ zwave
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ monitoring
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dozzle
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ speedtest

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bookstack
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ changedetection
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ duplicati
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ heimdall
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mosquitto
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ watchtower
```

## Automation

I use HomeAssistant (HA) for anything automation when it comes to my house (i.e. lights on/off when motion is/not detected). 

Add in Frigate (get a [Coral TPU](https://coral.ai/products/), trust me) to detect people, animals, or objects to the mix. Use the integration with HA and you'll get notified whenever someone is outside on your font porch or if a racoon is eating your garbage üò°.

Use the watchtower container to ensure you're running the latest release for all containers.

Duplicati for backing up my configurations to online storage on a schedule. 
> ‚ö†Ô∏è You don't want your configs to be in a Git repo.

## Efficiency + Convenience

Combining a `Makefile` with a properly structured repo is the best move I've made. It's incredibly convenient.

For example, if I want to restart all my core services. Instead of doing multiple `Docker compose down` calls I do a simple `Make restart core` and bam all my core containers restart!
